            <h2>A Game of Thrones</h2>
            <p>This first novel in the series, after which the television adaptation is named, was published in 1996,
                but didn't become a New York Times Bestseller until 2011. It serves as the basis for the first season of
                Game of Thrones, introducing the storylines of Daenerys Targaryen, the Wall, and the Great Houses of
                Westeros. The section about Daenerys, entitled <span>Blood</span> of the Dragon, won the Hugo Award for
                Best Novella.

            <h2>A Clash of Kings</h2>
            <p>A Clash of Kings, the 761-page sequel to A Game of Thrones, released only two years later, in 1998.
                Martin's productivity has, <span>apparently</span>, suffered significantly since his early days. In
                1999, it won the
                Locus Award for Best Novel, and eventually became the basis for the second season of the television
                series. It was praised by critics, especially for its ability to measure up to the first, with none of
                the usual drop-off in quality suffered by middle books in a series.</p>

            <h2>A Storm of Swords</h2>
            <p>The third novel in the series, A Storm of Swords, arrived in the year 2000, a whopping 973 pages which
                fans gobbled up with great aplomb. It was nominated for the Hugo Award, but lost to J.K. Rowling's Harry
                Potter and the Goblet of Fire. For <span>adaptation</span>, the novel was split into two, with the first
                half
                becoming the basis for season three and the second half the basis for season four.</p>

            <h2>A Feast for Crows</h2>
            <p>Martin's writing pace started to slow considerably by the time he reached A Feast for Crows, the fourth
                novel in the series. It wasn't released until five years after the third, in 2005. Reportedly, the
                manuscript was so long that Martin's <span>decided</span> to split the novel in two, and Martin,
                eccentric
                as always, decreed that instead of splitting the novel chronologically, he would split it by character
                and location, a painstaking separation process which delayed the novel's release.</p>
